12 Reasons why you should learn Ruby on Rails,Deciding what programming language to start with can be tedious and frustrating. Here are 12 reasons why Ruby on Rails is the right language for you!,"<p>“Learning to program is exciting: it's stimulating, fun, develops new ways of 

thinking, and in a very short time you can build programs that will impress 

your friends and family! Discovering the joy of programming was the spark that 

started my professional life and impressed the teenage beauty who, 40 years 

later, is still the love of my life!“ - John Hennessy President, Stanford University </p>

<p>It was only 7 months ago and I was completely new to this whole Tech Startups 

and ‘coding’ phenomenon. It was amazing the things you see in the media or on 

the internet with publications like TechCrunch or StartupSmart, where you hear 

about all these amazing Tech Startups getting funded or getting traction and 

even more amazingly, making social impact. </p>

<p>I originally came to the ‘coding’ world simply to learn some basic skills to help 

myself in my digital marketing prospects. Being a university student in such a 

tough job market, it always seems that an employer wants more than just your 

usual complementary skills to the job requirements – you have to have the ‘X 

factor’. </p>

<p>However, I never knew what language I should build cool stuff. Like, I knew that 

I should learn HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, but I never knew how to actual 

incorporate these skills when learning into building an actual tech startup. </p>

<p>Since then, not only have I nearly had one job offer each day for having skills to 

build Ruby on Rails applications, I’m still a complete beginner and I’ve built apps 

which are on <a href""http://www.heroku.com"" target=_blank"">Heroku</a>.</p> 

<p>How does a complete beginner with no clue what so ever, build apps and now 

even teaches the language and framework? Here are the 15 best reasons why 

you should learn Ruby on Rails:</p>

<p><strong>1. Beginner Friendly </p></strong>

<p>Ruby on Rails was amazing when I first started out less than a year ago. 

The ‘cleanliness’ of the structure of the code made it pretty easy for myself to 

pick up. It just started making sense and to see the ‘easy-to-read’ relationship 

between the front-end and back-end applications work in sync truly made it 

an enjoyable experience. It is an easy language for experienced programmers 

to quickly pick up and to pump out quick apps when they feel like it. Obviously 

fellow newbies, start with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>2. Perfect for MVP </p></strong>

<p>I’m a big believer that if you want to build an amazing tech startup, not only 

should you gain customer validation, but gain customer validation through 

proof. Ruby on Rails is the perfect language and framework to build quick MVP 

prototypes to show roughly (or extensively if you pick it up) how your startup 

will operate. If you gain some users, perfect, you have done it quickly and very 

cheaply in a short period of time. Now, you will be able to find tech co-founders 

in no time.</p>

<p><strong>3. Keeping it Lean </p></strong>

<p>This also comes back to reason number 2. Learning Ruby on Rails is cheap. 

Whether you do <a href=""http://openeducationchallenge.eu/blog/why-all-tech-entrepreneurs-must-know-about-code"" target=""_blank"">online free courses</a> (although limited) or 

part time courses, or even a boot camp, learning Ruby is really based on time 

investment. No matter your experience level, you can build something cheap 

which is really cool for the world to see. </p>

<p><strong>4. Quick application </p></strong>

<p>When I first started using Ruby on Rails, I was amazed how quickly you can build 

an app. I remember in my first class, we built Facebook in just one day – all the 

functionality. It was amazing how cool it was to see something built so quickly 

for myself to built that.</p>

<p><strong>5. Developer Happiness </p></strong>

<p>Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming 

language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro ""Matz"" 

Matsumoto in Japan. It was originally built for ‘developer happiness’ and when 

you ask any developer you meet, they would know that Ruby on Rails is a great 

way to build apps (although opinions vary from developer to developer). From 

my experience, I just really enjoyed how easy it was to read and follow – I 

honestly though ‘code’ was just all 0’s and 1’s but Ruby on Rails has opened my 

eyes and brings out my creative side without much frustration. Now that is true 

happiness.</p>

<p><strong>6. Amazing Community </p></strong>

<p>The community for Ruby on Rails is amazing. There are countless of online free 

tutorials and help with major development questions and answer sites, such 

as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"" target=""_blank"">Stack Overflow</a>, which will help you on your 

journey to building something great. If you want to begin your development 

career and build something great, head to Meetup groups. At The Coder Factory, 

we hold a Meetup called <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Sunday-
Coder-Club/"" target=""_blank"">Sunday Coder Club</a> where all languages come together and learn code, but there are 

specific groups which are primarily just for Ruby enthusiasts and newbies. Don’t 

be afraid to go along, they are cool people. </p>

<p><strong>7. Open Source </p></strong>

<p>One of the best things about Ruby on Rails, with being completely new to 

building applications, is how much you can do without actually knowing that 

much at all. Not only is it free of charge, it’s also free to use, copy, modify, and 

distribute.</p>

<p><strong>8. Bring ideas into life </p></strong>

<p>Again, this does come back to reason number 2, but what is so awesome about 

Ruby on Rails is that you can bring your ideas to fruition very quickly and inspire 

others to do the same. You can make any app idea you want.</p> 

<p><strong>9. Understand more about technology</p></strong>
<p>I believe coding is creative. It’s the new creative arts in my opinion – particularly 

in the 21st

and we don’t know how they are built – and for most, no one has a clue. Ruby on 

Rails will get you thinking outside of the square. In my experience, and I know 

plenty of others, it has opened up my understanding of the digital world. What 

 Century. Everyone can draw a painting, yet we use apps everyday 

was once a mystery now seems so clear. It’s actually a really cool bragging right 

to have to understand technology, people think you are ‘smart’ – but you don’t 

have to b<e!</p>

<p><strong>10. Innovative thinking </p></strong>

<p>This sounds familiar to what I just said, but learning Ruby on Rails will give you 

an amazing scope of how things work in the world and in business – particularly 

in technology businesses. Whether you’re in business or everyday life in work, 

we are always sending strategists, creatives and some team management people. 

If you have a better understanding of technology, two things will happen: 

o Have more innovative ideas about processes, systems and improve 

efficiency through technology

o And you also treat your internal and external partners in a considerably 

more effective manner.</p>

<p><strong>11. It will create better job opportunities </p></strong> 

<p>Not to long ago I posted a blog about <a href=""https://thecoderfactory.com/posts/top-15-sites-built-with-ruby-on-rails"" target=""_blank"">Top 15 sites built with Ruby on Rails </a>

 and 

talked about cool jobs you can get, like working for Bloomberg (which was built 

with Ruby). There is a high demand for Ruby developers out there and some are 

willing to take people who have only just started their journey not long after. If 

you’re bored of your job, learn Ruby on Rails. </p>

<p><strong>12. Produce complex websites easily </p></strong>

<p>The greatest way of building a personal brand is having your own site. What 

better way instead of paying someone hundreds to thousands of dollars building 

your site, or even alternatives on the web, build your own awesome website. 

You can do anything with it and it doesn’t take long to build a website with Ruby. 

Even better yet, Ruby on Rails produces and provides an amazing experience 

where you can incorporate both front-end and back-end functionality quick and 

easy. Use Bootstrap! Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and 

easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of 

all sizes. You can easily sync it into your code fast and effectively and can build 

the most amazing User interfaces.</p>",http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/v1401845527/yhnkttuwzchvuhsunxv1.png,Why-Ruby-on-Rails-Right-Programming-Language,2014-06-04,7
Why Australia must embrace the digital age,While countries like the U.S. and China are investing heavily into the digital future Australia could be lagging behind if we don't take immediate action.,"<p style=""text-align:justify"">Dice, a US IT employment site, recently announced a historical dip of unemployment in the technology sector from 3.5% in Q1 2013 to 2.7% in Q1 2014. Anecdotes about poaching within the industry are all too common, especially between goliaths like Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo and Amazon. What does the local scene look like? Whilst it is developing, it&rsquo;s a far cry from thriving tech hubs like Silicon Valley, Berlin, Tel Aviv or New York. Is coding a skill that will benefit Australia&rsquo;s economy and social fabric? Is the internet economy even worth the attention when Australia is able to live comfortably off its resources in the short term?</p>


<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">What are the numbers?</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">91% of Australia&rsquo;s population was using the internet as at January 2014. On a per capita basis <a href=""http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media-centre/news/2013/12/online-economy-continues-to-bloom-world-internet-project-finds.html"" target=""_blank"">Australians were spending $2,616 p.a. online </a>(this only includes online shopping and thus excludes services). <a href=""http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_AU/au/news-research/media-releases/2182c69146c81310VgnVCM2000001b56f00aRCRD.htm"" target=""_blank"">Deloitte</a> found that the whole industry was worth $50 Billion in 2010 which is almost the size of the whole retail industry and bigger than Australia&rsquo;s annual iron ore exports. In total there were 190,000 people employed in the internet sector and complementary industries, which represents ~ 1.7% of Australia&rsquo;s workforce.</p>



<p style=""text-align:justify"">The recent PwC <a href=""http://www.digitalpulse.pwc.com.au/australian-tech-startup-ecosystem/"" target=""_blank"">Startup Economy report </a> suggests that high growth technology companies could account for 1) 4% of the GDP which equals $109 Billion (compared to approximately 0.2% today) and 2) 540.000 jobs by 2033.</p>



<p style=""text-align:justify"">Internationally the number of internet users is expected to reach 3 Billion and the combined net worth of the G-20 digital economies will equal US $4.2 Trillion, according to a study conducted by <a href=""https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/media_entertainment_strategic_planning_4_2_trillion_opportunity_internet_economy_g20/"" target=""_blank"">Boston Consulting Group</a>.</p>


<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">Don&rsquo;t be passive, create something!</h4>



<p style=""text-align:justify"">There is no question that the internet is playing a huge role in nearly every aspect of our lives. It&rsquo;s a place where we search for and buy products and services, where we connect with friends and work colleagues; it&rsquo;s a source of media content, and even a place of productivity.</p>


<p style=""text-align:justify"">In fact the BCG report found, that 77% of the Americans asked would rather give up chocolate than going without the internet for a year. But while there are many people out there who have seen the opportunity technology presents to us, most of us remain passive consumers of those services. There continues to be a myth that technology is difficult, which is not the case. There are many accounts out of kids creating valuable apps. For example there is the inspiring <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/26/robert-nay-bubble-ball-14-year-old-built-iphone-app_n_910170.html"" target=""_blank"">story</a> of 14 year old Robert Nay who created a game called Bubble Ball, dethroning Angry Birds in January 2011 from its number one spot on the iTunes App Store. Or the story of <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com.au/homeless-coder-2013-9#ixzz2g1h3LeUK"" target=""_blank"">Leo</a>, a homeless guy from New York who learned coding through the generosity of a developer who passed him on his daily commute and who has succeeded in creating his own app in just eight weeks.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">How can we capitalize on this opportunity?</h4>



<p style=""text-align:justify"">Australians need to develop the skills of the future to harness the opportunities the digital age presents. <a href=""http://docs.employment.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/ictprofessions.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Official statements </a> suggest that there is no shortage of skilled IT professionals including web developers on the Australian market. This stands in stark contrast to what industry insiders say. Matt Barrie, CEO of freelancer.com states in the <a href=""http://www.afr.com/p/technology/freelancer_com_chief_blasts_government_V57V8DrUL2eaztlF6Wbw0O"" target=""_blank"">Australian Financial Review</a> that it is incredibly hard to find qualified staff for modern technology companies, while government bodies still look at basic technician and administrator roles when talking about ICT professions. The recent Startupaus.org <a href=""http://startupaus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/startupaus_infographic_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Crossroads report</a> states that only 2% of Australian university graduates acquired ICT skills while the demand doubled and only 2% of 2 million Australian kids have been exposed to entrepreneurial skills. In fact tech companies have to go and look for applicants overseas with developer programmers being the fourth most nominated occupation for temporary visa applications in 2012-13. Australians need to acquire coding skills to prevent our digital economy from falling behind.</p>



<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">How is The Coder Factory involved in solving this problem?</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Since September 2013 we have taught over fifty students to be more confident with their coding skills in classes ranging from beginner to expert . A big success story for The Coder Factory has been Mark Collins, one of our first students, was accepted into both <a href=""http://incubate.org.au"" target=""_blank"">Incubate</a> and Telstra&#39;s <a href=""http://muru-d.com"" target=""_blank""> Muru-D</a> after completing his Rails coding course. Mark has built <a href=""http://www.vistr.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Vistr</a> an online financial tool that lets small businesses improve their cashflow to form better forecasting. The Coder Factory also has 4 students working at Black Citrus.</p>


<p style=""text-align:justify"">Through Coder Club we have assembled volunteers to teach coding skills at 5 schools all around Sydney, these classes will be delivered weekly over the next school term. The objective of this initiative is to 1) highlight coding is fun 2) inspire future use of technology 3) enable kids to create something tangible and rewarding using technology. As we grow a key strategic pillar of ours is to deliver many more classes all around Australia to help spark an interest in technology.</p>

Everything you need to know about Heartbleed,Even after three weeks we are still being contacted by people about the Heartbleed bug. This is why we decided to create this comprehensive article that will leave no question unanswered.,"<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">A story of heartbeats</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">About three weeks ago a major flaw in the open source SSL software created a hitherto unknown outcry not only in tech savvy but also in mainstream media. But what exactly is Heartbleed apart from being the first bug with a beautiful logo? The Coder Factory tells you everything you need to know about Heartbleed and what actions you should take.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">What happened?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">On March 21st Neel Mehta of Google Security discovered the vulnerability in the SSL certificate. Google then created a patch to fix the problem and applied it progressively to its services. On April the 1st the Open SSL team was notified and a patch was then applied to fix the software which in its latest version 1.0.1g. is immune for attacks trying to exploit the bug. On April the 7th most of the world found out about Heartbleed which by that time got a pretty little website run by the Finish IT security firm Codenomicon that discovered the bug separately to Mehta on April the 2nd. What followed was an intensive coverage of Heartbleed in almost every publication.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">What is Heartbleed?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Heartbleed is a tiny little bug in the OpenSSL TLS (Transport Layer Security) &lsquo;heartbeat&rsquo; mechanism. TLS is a protocol that is used to secure communication between web services, by exchanging a symmetric key. The logic behind this is pretty much similar to your Bluetooth encryption. Only if you insert a specified key, your devices will connect (attention: oversimplification!!). The Heartbeat mechanism is nothing more than a periodic signal that ensures the key is valid. The bug in this mechanism is a missing bounds check that can be used to fetch data from a server. In normal use the heartbeat request sends a message with a payload, typically a text string along with the payloads length. The receiving server must then send the exact same payload back to ensure encryption. The missing bounds check allows attackers to extend the length of the request, permitting them to receive a much longer response containing the text string but also whatever 496 characters (in case of a 4 character string) happened to be in the server memory before. That could be completely useless data but it could also contain master keys, passwords, and usernames which then could be used to attain further data such as credit card information.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""img-thumbnail"" src=""http://s30.postimg.org/y6b2dv26p/both.png"" /></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All this wouldn&rsquo;t be worth discussing if this was an isolated bug that only appeared on your mums online shop for handmade socks. But the adoption of OpenSSL is estimated to be two thirds of the servers currently on the internet. Among the affected websites were Eventbrite, OKCupid and even the website of the FBI. The online magazine Ars Technica points out that OpenSSL is &ldquo;by far the Internet&rsquo;s most popular open-source cryptographic library and TLS implementation&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">What can I do?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">First of all change your passwords! No one knows on which scale the bug has been exploited so changing your passwords is a necessary precaution all of us should take. There are various tools out there that are supposed to detect if the site is affected one of them being AppCheck by Codenomicon. If you are an administrator or webmaster you should already have applied the patch. Reissue your SSL certificates and urge users to change their passwords!</p>

The ABC of Code,"Ever wondered if there is a blog article out there that tells you everything (yes everything!!) you ever need to know? Wonder no more, here is the ABC of code.","<p><strong>A - Angular.JS</strong> is what HTML would have been, had it been designed to build web-apps. It is an open source web application framework maintained by Google and it&rsquo;s community. The framework adapts and extends traditional HTML to better serve dynamic content. Angular.js follows the Model-View-Controller pattern of software engineering. The most notable feature of Angular.js is its two way data binding which reduces the amount of code you have to write significantly. The Coder Factory offers Australias first Angular.js course.</p>

<p><strong>B - Bootstrap</strong> is a framework for front-end development of responsive sleek looking mobile first web applications. It contains HTML and CSS based templates for typography, buttons, forms and general interface components. Basically, Bootstrap is a very easy and fast way to give your app a sleek, well designed look.</p>

<p><strong>C - CSS</strong>, short for Cascading Style Sheet is a language to describe the look and formatting written in a markup language such as HTML. Primarily it is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation in a document. Almost every website in the world uses CSS to describe their presentation, so you should definitely have a look into it. Of course you will learn in our courses about this integral part as well.</p>

<p><strong>D - DRY</strong> for don&rsquo;t repeat yourself. Remember that sales guy who told you the same thing five times, packaged in different words? Didn&rsquo;t feel good, did it? DRY is a principle in software development aimed at reducing repetition of information of any kind. If you apply this principle throughout every piece of code you write, the modification of a single element won&rsquo;t prompt you to change an element in a logically unrelated part of your code. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p><strong>E</strong> - Every code should be <strong>elegant</strong>. This goes back to the mindset that programming is art. There are people who will ask you &ldquo;why write elegant code if you can write effective code?&rdquo;. However, we think that elegance serves this purpose much better since it leads to more concise and maintainable code. You should always remember that code is read more than written. You don&rsquo;t want to make your code a black box that will take your colleagues a lifetime to figure out. So take a little time, make it pretty!</p>

<p><strong>F - Flash</strong> was developed by Adobe and is used to create animations, graphics and rich internet applications. Most likely the last movie you illegally streamed on a sketchy site was delivered to you by Adobe flash player. Although blamed to be quite resource consuming and insecure it is still used on many websites. You probably heard about Steve Jobs refusing to use Flash on Apple devices. If it really was for the named shortcomings or his personal quarrels with Adobe we will probably never find out. Although HTML5 is predicted to replace Flash in no time, it is still worth having a look into it.</p>

<p><strong>G - Github</strong> is every coders best friend (apart from caffeine). With over 11.5 million repositories it is the largest host of code in the world. Github contains social networking features to allow developers to collaborate on their projects which makes it invaluable for maintaining open source software as well as private projects. Github offers free and paid plans, just select what you need. Fun fact: Github is built with Ruby on Rails, the framework The Coder Factory teaches you!</p>

<p><strong>H - Hydra code</strong> is a piece of code that cannot be fixed. Like the ancient Greek monster it sprouts two heads for every head that Hercules would cut off. Code that behaves like this will introduce at least two more bugs for every bug you fix. You won&rsquo;t have another choice than to rewrite the whole code. Sorry bro.</p>

<p><strong>I - Graphic User Interface</strong>, well it&rsquo;s kind of self explaining. This is everything you see and interact with. The first GUI was invented at Stanford Research Institute and further developed by Xerox PARC. After visiting Xerox, Steve Jobs used the technology first in the Apple Lisa and then in the Macintosh, which was revolutionary back then. After Bill Gates released Windows GUI this funny conversation happened: Steve:&quot;You&rsquo;re stealing from us!&rdquo; Bill replied &quot;I think it&#39;s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>J - Javascript</strong> is a dynamic (mostly client side) programming language that allows you to update content on your webpage without refreshing the page. While Angular.js is a pretty cool framework, JavaScript is the foundation it is built on. It was originally developed at Netscape to battle Microsoft in the browser wars. We teach Javascript in our advanced app development courses.</p>

<p><img src=""http://s28.postimg.org/qg4bwfzjh/Knuth.png"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>K - Donald Knuth</strong> is the author of &ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rdquo; one of our favourite books, so we just couldn&rsquo;t leave him out of this list. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University and considered to be the father of the analysis of algorithms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>L - Libraries of code</strong> are collections of implementations of behaviour that has an interface by which the behaviour is invoked. Sounds complicated, hm? It basically means that the code is organized in such a way that it can be used by multiple programs that have no connection to each other. Then the user only needs to know the interface of the library and not the internal logic.</p>

<p><strong>M - MongoDB</strong>, derived from humongous, is a cross platform document oriented database. Being a NoSQL database it uses JSON like dynamic schemes instead of traditional relational table based structures, which makes the integration of data in web apps a lot easier. MongoDB has been adopted by some of the major sites such as Ebay, Craigslist and even the New York Times.</p>

<p><strong>N - Nopping</strong> is coder for zoning out. Derived from NOP (no-operation) it is napping in programming jargon. Everyone needs a break every now and then. Have a nop instead!</p>

<p><strong>O - Object oriented programming</strong> is a paradigm that represents the concept of objects that are described by attributes and altered by methods. Objects are usually instances of classes, design to interact with each other to design an application. Many of the major programming languages such as C++, Java, Ruby and PHP are object oriented.</p>

<p><strong>P - Push based</strong> communication describes a request for an interaction that is initiated by the publisher, e.g. the server instead of a pull that comes from the client.</p>

<p><strong>Q - Quality of Code</strong> is a broad term and every programmer will have their own definition. We like to describe quality code as legible (the code clearly states the intent), testable, flexible (dependencies should be minimized), compliant (the code should comply with its requirements) and economical (the code should make reasonable use of its resources). Together this principle is known as LTFCE.</p>

<p><strong>R - Ruby on Rails</strong> is a web development framework using Ruby as a language. It was developed by David Heinemeier-Hansson around 2005. It is a very streamlined framework since it makes a lot of decisions for you on how things should be organized and how things should be done. This allows you as a developer to focus on the functionality of your app instead of worrying about the unpleasant details.</p>

<p><strong>S - Scaffolding</strong> is a technique used by Model-View-Controller frameworks (such as Ruby on Rails). With scaffolding a developer can specify a description of how a database might be used. This allows you to generate code that e.g. reads, creates or deletes database entries in a very streamlined way.</p>

<p><strong>T - Alan Turing</strong> is considered to be the patron saint of computer science, although never being officially being declared a saint (who cares?). Born in 1912 he is the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. His Turing Machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. It is considered the first model of an actual computer.</p>

<p><strong>U - Usability testing</strong> will be an important task before you go live with your app. Your code might be elegant, of high quality and non repetitive but if your usability is crap it is all in vain. You want to make your app as user friendly as possible, so people don&rsquo;t get lost in buying your super cool new product, right? A common technique is A/B testing in which you introduce two different versions to different audiences and monitor the reactions. Whatever works best will be adapted.</p>

<p><strong>V for View</strong>, Model, Controller (not necessarily in the right order) is a pattern for implementing user interfaces. The central component is the Model which contains application data, business logic rules and functions. The View is the actual output your users will see in their browsers. The Controller accepts input and converts it to commands for the Model or View.</p>

<p><strong>W - W3C</strong> (World Wide Web Consortium) is the main international standards organization for the web. Founded and led by Tim-Berners Lee, the inventor of the web, it is the guardian of the World Wide Web. It also has some pretty cool resources to learn code. Check out W3Schools!</p>

<p><strong>X - Experience</strong>. Many people think they can learn code and be done with it. The truth is: you will never stop learning as a developer. Technologies are changing rapidly and you will have to keep up to scratch throughout your career. Just another reason to take a Coder Factory course, huh?</p>

<p><strong>Y - Yoda condition</strong> is programming jargon for code where two parts of an expression are reversed from the typical order of in a conditional statement. Just like &ldquo;learn to code you should, young padawan&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src=""http://s21.postimg.org/4c5r2dkvb/Zuse.png"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Z</strong> - Of course we couldn&rsquo;t leave Konrad <strong>Zuse</strong> out of this comprehensive list. He was a German scientist who built the first programmable computer, the Turing-complete Z3. After WW2 IBM optioned his patents which was the first acknowledgement of his work outside Germany. You might also remember the character Zuse from &ldquo;Tron - Legacy&rdquo; who betrays Sam in order to gain control of the grid. This, of course, is reference to the legendary scientist.</p>

"Why you should ""MVP"" before going big","Building a Mimimum Viable Product is a crucial step to validate your business idea. Before putting too much time and resources in your startup, make sure you have tested it beforehand!","<p>“Whether it’s a small idea or a big one just do an MVP to raise the money you need” - <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicascorpio"" target=_blank"">Jessica Scorpio</a>, Getaround </p>


<p>There has always been a debate about whether or not people should put in the time and money to build an MVP or to go actually find customers for your tech startup. Of course, finding customers is necessary but what about when it actually comes to the startup?</p>

<p>Being an entrepreneur, I have always had numerous ideas and never knew what the right process was to go about it. I have asked many people would they use my platform if it were to exist and pay for its services, but I got asked on most occasions, “does the platform exist so I can try it out?” When this happened I realised that there is more to the process of getting customer validation then just asking customers if they would use my services, as there is truly a difference between ‘Talk’ and ‘Action’. </p>

<h4>So what does ‘Talk’ and ‘Action’ mean?</h4>

<p>This article I will explain the combination of building an MVP and getting customer validation as being one of the most critical things to do before putting in the time and effort of trying to ‘make it big’, whether it is trying to raise capital, spend money on marketing or anything that involves huge investment timely and financially.</p>


<p><strong>What is a Minimum Viable Product?</strong> </p>

<p>A minimum viable product is “that product which has just those features and no more that allows you to ship a product that early adopters see and, at least some of whom resonate with, pay you money for, and start to give you feedback on”.</p>

<p>This definition explains everything in a nutshell. This has been one of the biggest lessons I have learnt in making it a quick and easy process to learn and build a prototype quickly to prove how the system works and gain customers. </p>

<p>Despite saying this, there are many ways of defining what an MVP is without it necessarily being a software prototype. It can be anything from landing page testing, market research or maybe even an advertising campaign – anything really. Purely from a tech startup and app point of view, building a software MVP is critical for optimal success. </p>

<br>
<br>
<h4>No Value in just ‘Talking’ </h4>

<p>As previously mentioned, there is a big difference in just ‘talking’ about an idea and actually proving the system concept. It’s easy to think to just gain customers such as friends and family, as we naturally do, but will they be your <b>actual</b> customers in the end. That’s the next challenge, who are your customers? How will you approach them? How will you approach them with an ‘idea’ without getting them to use your system? I’m not saying it can’t be done; it’s just a harder approach. </p>

<p>So coming back to the question, where does the value come in? Having an idea is value, however it is very little. Being able to surpass the ‘talking’ stage into MVP stage dramatically increases your value and also your potential scalability of your tech startup – proof of concept. </p>

<h4>How can you speed up the process of validating your startup and product offering? Here are 5 key questions </h4>

<p><strong>1.	What do your customers want? What can you learn from them?</strong></p>

<p>“When you focus on figuring the right thing to build-the thing customers want and will pay for-you need not spend months waiting for a product beta launch to change the company's direction.” – Validated Learning</p>

<p><strong>2.	What are my customers looking for? What is the value?</strong></p>

<p>Find out specifically the value that you generate. Is the product your actual value or is it your service platform? What needs to be improved for higher customer satisfaction? </p>

<p><strong>3.	What are your marketing channels? Do they work?</strong></p>

<p>Getting back quality information about your marketing channels is fantastic. Don’t spend money on marketing for an MVP. Bootstrap – social media and content marketing is the answer. Get feedback from Google analytics – analyse conversions. Split test. A great resource is Neil Patel’s <a href=""http://http://www.quicksprout.com/"" target=""_blank"">QuickSprout</a> – sign up and implement his strategies without paying a cent. </p>

<p><strong>4.	What’s the size of market and traction?</strong></p>

<p>This goes back relevant to number 3. Who are the major players in the market and how is their platform operating? </p>

<p>Analyse and measure. What converts to sales and what doesn’t? Again, split test (https://www.optimizely.com/). </p>

<p><strong>5.	Are you making Money?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can make money from an MVP. That’s what it is all about. If you start making more that you could possibly imagine, you’re onto a good thing – and best thing yet, you didn’t have to spend too much time or money to achieve your goals.  If you aren’t, that’s great. Learn from the failure. Now pivot and measure again – eventually you will succeed. </p>

<p><strong>Simple MVP – Build features Later</strong></p>

<p>It’s amazing the amount of people who have wasted thousands to build an app or a tech startup because they think, “it’s going to change the world”. Don’t get me wrong – I absolutely love these people because that’s the way that I think and that all entrepreneurs should think.  In one case, I have come across a guy who outsourced and spent $50K and the app has never been finished for now 6 months – incredible. I don’t understand the people who are willing to throw away money without even testing whether or not their service will work. Build something simple. Simple products are easier for your users to understand and use. They allow for a simple, compelling value proposition making them easier to market. Then you add more complex features one at a time, where you find out what provides greater value for your customers and users.  You will save money and time. </p>

<p><strong>MVP is Low Risk </strong><p>

<p>The best benefit yet - building an MVP is low risk. In other words, it’s the ultimate trial period at a low cost. It’s actually an amazing learning experience that has embraced not only myself to learn from failure, but fellow entrepreneurs I know. Why would you ever build a team, develop a product worth thousands to tens of thousands without even knowing if anyone would actually use it (believe me, it has been done by plenty of people). </p>

<p>It comes back to Eric Ries’ <a href=""https://thecoderfactory.com/posts/what-is-lean-startup"" target=""_blank"">Lean Startup Methodology</a>. It’s amazing. While the whole ‘lean startup theory’ seems something that people <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/16/lean-startups-boo/"" target=""_blank"">question</a>, the underlying values and principles it concurs is something that should never be underestimated in increasing your chances of entrepreneurial success. </p>


<p>Build – Measure – Learn! </p>

Why Kids should learn Scratch: Programming for kids,"The ability to code is quickly becoming the new ‘ABC’. With a quickly growing digital   revolution, the ability for kids to code has never been more prominent. Here is how it can be fun   to learn.","<p>“For most people on Earth, the digital revolution hasn't even started yet. Within the next 10 

years, all that will change. Let's get the whole world coding!“ – <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/

profile/eric-schmidt/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Schmidt (Executive Chairman, Google).</a></p> 

<p>If you’re into technology, it’s most likely that you have come across the phenomenon of 

“teaching Kids to code”. It’s starting to become inevitable – this is truly fantastic. Through the 

quickly growing digital revolution, coding will become very important when it comes to the 

future generation, not only to fill in the technological roles that are now scarce, but also 

to truly understand how this world operates. Software is eating the world! </p>

<p>“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you 

how to think” – Steve Jobs</p>

<p>Coding is more than just a skill. It’s becoming a necessity. It truly opens your eyes 

to a world of amazing possibilities. Despite Steve Wozniack stating that <a href=""http://

www.businessinsider.com.au/steve-jobs-never-wrote-computer-code-for-apple-2013-8""

target=""_blank"">Steve Jobs did not code (or barely did)</a>, he knew about its impact and the 

ability to think outside the square. For the future of man-kind, kids being able to learn code 

and practically build programs to make the world a better place, is truly critical. And besides, it 

teaches your kids to think and have fun at the same time – what parent doesn’t want that?</p>

<p>There are so many fantastic resources for kids to learn code but often can be seen as a 

difficult stigma by parents and teachers in order to support kids in learning code. </p> 

<p>I have enjoyed my time thus far with <a href=""https://thecoderfactory.com/posts/

<h4>Scratch! What is Scratch?</h4> 

<p>Initiated in 2003, Scratch was first developed by MIT’s <a href=""http://www.ted.com/speakers/

mitch_resnicktarget=""_blank"">Mitchel Resnick</a>, for the purpose of making the learning 

process of programming simple.</p>

<p>“With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and 

share your creations with others in the online community. Scratch helps young people learn to 

think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 

21st century.” </p>

<h4>Who should use Scratch? </h4>

<p>Scratch is designed specifically for ages 8 – 16 (although if your 14 and above I think you’re 

capable of surpassing Scratch – <a href=""http://learn.code.org/flappy/1"" target=""_blank"">here</a> is a great way to learn more extensive code. You can create your own Flappy Bird) however, it is suitable for all ages. </p>

<h4>Why use Scratch?</h4>

<p>Scratch is perfect for kids to learn. Here are the reasons why:

<p>• Gives students greater sense of control and responsibility for the learning process. 

</p>

<p>• Encourages creative problem solving. </p>

<p>• Allows for the designing of projects that are interdisciplinary (art, technology, math, 

and sciences). </p>

<p>• Helps students learn to put themselves in the minds of others; since they need to 

consider how others will use the things they create. </p>

<p>• Provides opportunities for reflection and collaboration. </p>

<p>• Sets up a positive-feedback loop of learning, where students can build on ideas. </

12 Reasons why you should learn Ruby on Rails,Deciding what programming language to start with can be tedious and frustrating. Here are 12 reasons why Ruby on Rails is the right language for you!,"<p>“Learning to program is exciting: it's stimulating, fun, develops new ways of 

thinking, and in a very short time you can build programs that will impress 

your friends and family! Discovering the joy of programming was the spark that 

started my professional life and impressed the teenage beauty who, 40 years 

later, is still the love of my life!“ - John Hennessy President, Stanford University </p>

<p>It was only 7 months ago and I was completely new to this whole Tech Startups 

and ‘coding’ phenomenon. It was amazing the things you see in the media or on 

the internet with publications like TechCrunch or StartupSmart, where you hear 

about all these amazing Tech Startups getting funded or getting traction and 

even more amazingly, making social impact. </p>

<p>I originally came to the ‘coding’ world simply to learn some basic skills to help 

myself in my digital marketing prospects. Being a university student in such a 

tough job market, it always seems that an employer wants more than just your 

usual complementary skills to the job requirements – you have to have the ‘X 

factor’. </p>

<p>However, I never knew what language I should build cool stuff. Like, I knew that 

I should learn HTML, CSS and some JavaScript, but I never knew how to actual 

incorporate these skills when learning into building an actual tech startup. </p>

<p>Since then, not only have I nearly had one job offer each day for having skills to 

build Ruby on Rails applications, I’m still a complete beginner and I’ve built apps 

which are on <a href""http://www.heroku.com"" target=_blank"">Heroku</a>.</p> 

<p>How does a complete beginner with no clue what so ever, build apps and now 

even teaches the language and framework? Here are the 15 best reasons why 

you should learn Ruby on Rails:</p>

<p><strong>1. Beginner Friendly </p></strong>

<p>Ruby on Rails was amazing when I first started out less than a year ago. 

The ‘cleanliness’ of the structure of the code made it pretty easy for myself to 

pick up. It just started making sense and to see the ‘easy-to-read’ relationship 

between the front-end and back-end applications work in sync truly made it 

an enjoyable experience. It is an easy language for experienced programmers 

to quickly pick up and to pump out quick apps when they feel like it. Obviously 

fellow newbies, start with Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p><strong>2. Perfect for MVP </p></strong>

<p>I’m a big believer that if you want to build an amazing tech startup, not only 

should you gain customer validation, but gain customer validation through 

proof. Ruby on Rails is the perfect language and framework to build quick MVP 

prototypes to show roughly (or extensively if you pick it up) how your startup 

will operate. If you gain some users, perfect, you have done it quickly and very 

cheaply in a short period of time. Now, you will be able to find tech co-founders 

in no time.</p>

<p><strong>3. Keeping it Lean </p></strong>

<p>This also comes back to reason number 2. Learning Ruby on Rails is cheap. 

Whether you do <a href=""http://openeducationchallenge.eu/blog/why-all-tech-entrepreneurs-must-know-about-code"" target=""_blank"">online free courses</a> (although limited) or 

part time courses, or even a boot camp, learning Ruby is really based on time 

investment. No matter your experience level, you can build something cheap 

which is really cool for the world to see. </p>

<p><strong>4. Quick application </p></strong>

<p>When I first started using Ruby on Rails, I was amazed how quickly you can build 

an app. I remember in my first class, we built Facebook in just one day – all the 

functionality. It was amazing how cool it was to see something built so quickly 

for myself to built that.</p>

<p><strong>5. Developer Happiness </p></strong>

<p>Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming 

language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro ""Matz"" 

Matsumoto in Japan. It was originally built for ‘developer happiness’ and when 

you ask any developer you meet, they would know that Ruby on Rails is a great 

way to build apps (although opinions vary from developer to developer). From 

my experience, I just really enjoyed how easy it was to read and follow – I 

honestly though ‘code’ was just all 0’s and 1’s but Ruby on Rails has opened my 

eyes and brings out my creative side without much frustration. Now that is true 

happiness.</p>

<p><strong>6. Amazing Community </p></strong>

<p>The community for Ruby on Rails is amazing. There are countless of online free 

tutorials and help with major development questions and answer sites, such 

as <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"" target=""_blank"">Stack Overflow</a>, which will help you on your 

journey to building something great. If you want to begin your development 

career and build something great, head to Meetup groups. At The Coder Factory, 

we hold a Meetup called <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Sunday-
Coder-Club/"" target=""_blank"">Sunday Coder Club</a> where all languages come together and learn code, but there are 

specific groups which are primarily just for Ruby enthusiasts and newbies. Don’t 

be afraid to go along, they are cool people. </p>

<p><strong>7. Open Source </p></strong>

<p>One of the best things about Ruby on Rails, with being completely new to 

building applications, is how much you can do without actually knowing that 

much at all. Not only is it free of charge, it’s also free to use, copy, modify, and 

distribute.</p>

<p><strong>8. Bring ideas into life </p></strong>

<p>Again, this does come back to reason number 2, but what is so awesome about 

Ruby on Rails is that you can bring your ideas to fruition very quickly and inspire 

others to do the same. You can make any app idea you want.</p> 

<p><strong>9. Understand more about technology</p></strong>
<p>I believe coding is creative. It’s the new creative arts in my opinion – particularly 

in the 21st

and we don’t know how they are built – and for most, no one has a clue. Ruby on 

Rails will get you thinking outside of the square. In my experience, and I know 

plenty of others, it has opened up my understanding of the digital world. What 

 Century. Everyone can draw a painting, yet we use apps everyday 

was once a mystery now seems so clear. It’s actually a really cool bragging right 

to have to understand technology, people think you are ‘smart’ – but you don’t 

have to b<e!</p>

<p><strong>10. Innovative thinking </p></strong>

<p>This sounds familiar to what I just said, but learning Ruby on Rails will give you 

an amazing scope of how things work in the world and in business – particularly 

in technology businesses. Whether you’re in business or everyday life in work, 

we are always sending strategists, creatives and some team management people. 

If you have a better understanding of technology, two things will happen: 

o Have more innovative ideas about processes, systems and improve 

efficiency through technology

o And you also treat your internal and external partners in a considerably 

more effective manner.</p>

<p><strong>11. It will create better job opportunities </p></strong> 

<p>Not to long ago I posted a blog about <a href=""https://thecoderfactory.com/posts/top-15-sites-built-with-ruby-on-rails"" target=""_blank"">Top 15 sites built with Ruby on Rails </a>

 and 

talked about cool jobs you can get, like working for Bloomberg (which was built 

with Ruby). There is a high demand for Ruby developers out there and some are 

willing to take people who have only just started their journey not long after. If 

you’re bored of your job, learn Ruby on Rails. </p>

<p><strong>12. Produce complex websites easily </p></strong>

<p>The greatest way of building a personal brand is having your own site. What 

better way instead of paying someone hundreds to thousands of dollars building 

your site, or even alternatives on the web, build your own awesome website. 

You can do anything with it and it doesn’t take long to build a website with Ruby. 

Even better yet, Ruby on Rails produces and provides an amazing experience 

where you can incorporate both front-end and back-end functionality quick and 

easy. Use Bootstrap! Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and 

easier. It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of 

all sizes. You can easily sync it into your code fast and effectively and can build 

the most amazing User interfaces.</p>",http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/v1401845572/e220chcuhaelv1mn9b0x.png,Why-Ruby-on-Rails-Right-Programming-Language,2014-05-22,0
Interview with Chris Withers,In this weeks talk we got Chris Withers to speak about his experience in our Brisbane Beginner Class and where he wants to take his new found skills to.,"<p><strong>Hi Chris, thanks for taking the time! Could you tell us a bit about you? </strong></p>

<p>Not a problem. I&rsquo;m an Economics/Law student at the University of Queensland, with a keen interest in tech start ups and entrepreneurship generally.</p>

<p><strong>You took our Brisbane Weekend Beginner class. Why did you decide to learn coding?</strong></p>

<p>Technology is undoubtedly the way of the future, and coding will be its language. After watching the presentation Coding Factory at Ignite, I was inspired to learn and felt that this program would be a great start.</p>

<p><strong>We believe that learning to code not only teaches you web development, but also thinking outside the box and crucial problem solving skills. Did you take any of this from the course?</strong></p>

<p>Coding is not for everyone. Fortunately, after grasping the basics I was able to understand the rational patterns that form code and visualise how it all fitted together. Even if you don&rsquo;t pursue it further, the course definitely gives you an appreciation for looking beyond the norm when it comes to solving problems.</p>

<p><strong>What use do you want to put your new skills to?</strong></p>

<p>Entrepreneurship. Never before has the barrier to entry been so low in terms of an emerging market and if you don&rsquo;t hop on board now, I fear you could miss the train. I paired up with a few software engineers and formed a start-up, and amhoping to put this code to furthering our projects.</p>

<p><strong>What part of programming do you consider the most compelling?</strong></p>

<p>Compelling is an interesting choice of word. Naturally, the heavy lifting is all back end, and it is something I can really appreciate despite having little knowledge of. That said, at the end of the day, often it&rsquo;s the front end design work that sells the product. I&rsquo;m definitely more of a front end kind of guy.</p>

<p><strong>Are you going to keep developing your coding skills? </strong></p>

<p>Most definitely. Already a few days after the course I was scouring GitHub for tutorials to increase the functionality of the web app I had created. The course really inspired me and got me passionate about coding and the endless possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>If you had the ability to build anything you ever dreamed of, what would it be?</strong></p>

<p>A place where people, enthusiastic about their passions, especially related to startups could connect and canvas their ideas &ndash; without worrying about harsh criticism or the possibility of having their concept stolen. Without new ideas, new frames of mind and new shifts in paradigm, the world wouldn&rsquo;t be what it is today.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks a lot for you time, Chris!</strong></p>

Interview with Kim Heras,"In this weeks talk we are happy to have Kim Heras of 25fifteen telling us his views about startups, accelerating and coding","<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Hi Kim, thanks for taking the time! Could you tell us a bit about yourself?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I&#39;m a Founding Partner at Startup Studio, 25Fifteen, and co-founder of renowned startup community organisation, PushStart. Also, I&#39;m a Director of Fishburners, Australia&rsquo;s leading tech startup co-working space.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have worked in the Australian tech startup community for over 10 years: As an entrepreneur, as the former editor of The Next Web, Australia and as an event organiser. I&#39;m the founder of the Sydney Tech Startup Meetup &ndash; Australia&rsquo;s longest running and largest tech startup meetup with over 3400 members &ndash; and the Sydney FinTech Startup Meetup.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Please tell us a bit more about the investment focus and strategy of 25fifteen?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We believe that startups are a craft - there are things you can do to improve your chances of success, learnable things, subject to the scientific method.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We&#39;re a group of successful entrepreneurs and industry veterans who use our execution experience, capital, and relationships to help startups reach a profitable exit.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We invest in and co-found startups. We focus on companies aiming for early and realistic exits, rather than the moonshots most venture investors look for.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We work closely with potential exit partners, so that we know what these companies are looking for, and can involve them in our companies early in the life cycle.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>When looking at new investment opportunities, what part do coding skills of the team members play in your decision?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Certainly a bonus to have but not critical.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Would a start up that has a first technical prototype have better chances for an investment with you than a start up without?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&rsquo;s not a dealbreaker if there&rsquo;s no technical prototype but having one would probably help to a) show that you&rsquo;re a do-er b) help explain how you think the product will work c) hopefully give you some data (from usage of that prototype) on how people will use it.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Many people claim that the Australian tech scene is still underdeveloped compared to Europe and the U.S. What would you say the Australian start-up ecosystem does well and where do we need to catch up?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We do everything well. We just need to do more of it.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>What is your general view on coding? Do you think it is an essential skill that should be taught to kids at an early age?</strong></p>

What I Love About Teaching People to Code,"I am a Ruby on Rails, web application development instructor and I love what I do. Teaching people to create apps with great tools and well designed platforms is a joy for me.","<h2 style=""text-align:justify"">What I teach</h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed teaching. Even in my days at IBM, I held technical workshops and end-user training for fellow employees, business partners and our customers. It is a great feeling to be able to share my knowledge with people, especially when it helps them in their work or lives.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Conducting training on software packages is one thing, but teaching coding is another kettle of fish altogether. Especially since teaching someone how to build their own apps, enables them to make a living for themselves, whether that&rsquo;s creating a tech startup company, or starting a new career in the IT industry.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Ruby on Rails is a great language and platform to teach people. It&rsquo;s easy for beginners to learn and it allows the students to quickly build things without having to be a computer scientist and understand everything about computers.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Of course it&rsquo;s great to teach the concepts of application and database design, software patterns and object oriented theory. But it&rsquo;s the practical building of apps using such a great framework that gives so much joy to all.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align:justify"">The way I teach</h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I&rsquo;m a self taught Rails coder and I think that has helped me a better Rails teacher. I learnt so many things the hard way, fumbling through tutorials and documentation, that I&rsquo;m able to see the platform through a beginner&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I also realise the importance of the student having a project they want to build. An app idea they are passionate about. This provides so much extra motivation for the student to persevere and get themselves over those inevitable hurdles.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The projects I provide for my students are applications that are familiar to them. That way the concepts make more sense as the students can relate to the functionality and application design.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Despite having taught myself Rails with tutorials I found in books and online, I have never enjoyed learning on my own, away from a classroom. Having a teacher explain concepts in their own words, drawing on a white board, relating the concepts to real world examples, has always been my preferred method of learning.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It&rsquo;s also the presence of other students, going through the same experience as myself, facing the same challenges. I find myself thinking, &quot;if that student can learn and understand this, so can I&quot;.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">So I&rsquo;m proud to teach in a classroom, providing a great experience for my students. Giving them opportunities to meet new friends and possible business partners. I love finding great ways to explain difficult concepts.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align:justify"">The students I teach</h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It is great to see people from all different backgrounds being drawn to coding. I am a believer that technology can solve so many of the world&rsquo;s challenges and that teaching more people to code might help us solve some problems sooner rather than later.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">My students are fitness trainers, stock brokers, cafe waiters, graphic designers. They&rsquo;re still at university or in their 50&rsquo;s, working 9-5 or unemployed. Some of them have played with HTML, others have created a game or two, but most have never programmed before in their life.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It&rsquo;s amazing to see my students find enjoyment in coding, especially when they were afraid they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to learn it. It gives me a buzz when I hear a student say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; as they refresh their browser and see the results of their coding.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">My favourite part is when the Rails concepts and power begins to make sense to the students. I see their eyes go wide and their smile become a grin as they realise the possibilities they now have in front of them. Now they can build anything they want. Their lives will never be the same.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It goes without saying that it&rsquo;s a thrill to see Coder Factory graduates go on to work in web development agencies and be accepted into incubators. It&rsquo;s the most rewarding feeling I&rsquo;ve had in my life.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align:justify"">The love of teaching coding</h2>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">As you can tell, I love what I do for a living. It takes energy to put on a great class every day - but it isn&rsquo;t work for me. I&rsquo;m not afraid to say that I&rsquo;m not yet the best teacher I can be, because I&rsquo;m still getting better every class that I run. I&rsquo;m always finding better ways to explain concepts, more interesting projects for the students to build, easier tools to help build their dreams.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">If you think you might enjoy being a coding instructor, give it a shot. Even if you aren&rsquo;t a coder now, go out there, find a class to attend and begin your journey to a rewarding career.</p>

Weekend talk: Jaryd Carolin,Jaryd is a gifted young entrepreneur whos startup Beak has just graduated from Incubate. We are happy to have a rising talent  in tech like him holding our next Angular.JS course!,"<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Hi <a href=""http://au.linkedin.com/in/jarydcarolin"" target=""_blank"">Jaryd</a>, thanks for taking the time! Please tell us a bit about yourself.</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I&rsquo;m 24 years old and am the co-founder of Sydney start-up <a href=""http://getbeak.com/"" target=""_blank"">Beak</a>. When I&rsquo;m not busy doing that I like to find time to play squash and learn violin. Oh, and teach coding of course.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">How did you get into coding?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When I was in my final year of university I decided to learn coding and create a website as a means to test my thesis hypothesis. So that was 2011. Back then I started out with Ruby on Rails, which is a great framework to learn from.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">You are the founder of a tech startup yourself. Could you tell us a bit about <a href=""http://getbeak.com/"" target=""_blank"">Beak</a>, what stage are you at and what success have you had so far?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Beak is a loyalty and social gifting platform for small to medium bricks and mortar retailers. It helps small businesses increase customer engagement with their brand and spread word of mouth amongst their loyal customers&rsquo; social circles. We launched in a few stores just this week; I think getting to this point really quickly has been our greatest achievement so far. We&rsquo;ve only been working on the idea for a few months so it&rsquo;s great to get out there and learn from our customers where we can take our product next.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">You are going to hold the AngularJS course at The Coder Factory. What fascinates you about the Angular approach, what would you say are the biggest advantages compared to e.g. JQuery?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I think the thing I love most about AngularJS is that I no longer have to directly interact with the DOM. Even though jQuery makes working with the DOM bearable, Angular takes it to a whole other level and it let&rsquo;s you focus on the more important structural elements of a smooth front-end interface.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Who should learn Angular.JS? What prerequisite training would you recommend before starting the course?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you&rsquo;re generally across HTML and CSS and have some basic JavaScript then you&rsquo;re good to go. The more you know about JavaScript the better, &ldquo;JavaScript: The Good Parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja&rdquo; are great books to further your knowledge.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Could you tell us a bit about the contents of the course? What key learning will students walk away with?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sure. By the end of the course students will be able to create their own AngularJS app and learn how to convert a regular site to a single-page app. It will be a mix of working on a sample app I have put together and applying what has been learned to their own personal projects, which I will assist in structuring and debugging. We&rsquo;ll cover a bunch of key AngularJS concepts, including state-based routing, scopes, directives, services, filters, form validation and so on.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">What is your key advice for anyone trying to learn coding?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To keep in mind that practical learning will take you the furthest and in the least amount of time. If you have a project idea, no matter how big or small, get started on it and you&rsquo;ll learn heaps about coding along the way to completing it.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Thanks for your time!</h4>

The Coder Factory is bringing coding to Sydney schools,The Coder Factory is partnering with Telstras Muru-D and UK based CodeClub to bring coding to Sydney schools. We are happy to announce that The Coder Factory is contributing to implement coding skills into the curriculum of Aussie primary school kids.,"<p style=""text-align:justify"">Together with our amazing partners <a href=""https://muru-d.com/"" target=""_blank"">Muru-D</a>, the Telstra backed accelerator and <a href=""http://codeclub.org.uk"" target=""_blank&quot;"">CodeClub</a> we are sending volunteers to Sydney primary schools to give kids the chance to learn coding, a skill that we believe will greatly enhance their life. Furthermore we want to help Australia overcome it&rsquo;s skill shortage in IT and we believe that starting with the youngest in our community is the right way to go.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">At least four primary schools over the next school term</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Last Wednesday (30th of April) we visited Hampden Road School, Lakemba in Sydneys West where almost all of the kids come from non-English speaking homes. After having an incredibly rewarding first lesson there we joined the first session at Lindfield East Public School that was as exciting as the first one. In this school term alone The Coder Factory is sending volunteers to at least two more schools in Sydney and one in Melbourne.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><img alt=""Hampden Road Public School"" src=""http://i60.tinypic.com/jq6ayp.jpg"" style=""width:650px"" />Wednesday 30th of April, Hampden Road Public School, Lakemba</p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">Teaching Aussie kids with established and tested teaching methods</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">To accomplish a great learning experience for the kids, we have partnered with the UK based initiative codeclub.uk.org that is supported by big brands such as Google, Samsung and Mozilla. Code Club was started in 2012 by Clare Sutcliffe and Linda Sandvik with only 120 schools participating. Aimed at kids aged 9-11, it created over 2200 clubs all over the UK to date. The clubs are run by volunteers who hold a weekly hour long lesson, teaching the visualized programming language <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu"" target=""_blank"">Scratch</a> that was developed at Harvard and MIT. Following this kids are introduced to HTML and CSS, the modern standard languages for front-end development. Participating schools only need to support these lessons with one teacher and ideally provide enough computers. Everything else is being provided by CodeClub and The Coder Factory. Through <a href=""https://twitter.com/annie_parker"" target=""_blank"">@Annie Parker</a> we got involved in this great initiative and we are extremely excited to grow it throughout Australia.</p>

Why we should all learn a little Code  – [Infographic] ,"The spike in the rise of enthusiasm in learning to code continues to prosper as big non-for-profit organisations such as Code.org seek to push the norm that coding is not just for “geeks” or “nerds”, but anyone can learn it. ","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.&ldquo; &ndash; Bill Gates</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Just like my recent blog post on the Infographic on the push to teach kids to learn code, there aren&rsquo;t many organisations in my opinion that are pushing to make coding mainstream in terms of teaching everyday older adolescents to baby boomers to your grandma or grandfather, about the wonders of coding. Coding isn&rsquo;t that much different to learning a different language like French or Italian.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite this Infographic being created back in 2012, it has no different effect to what the message being portrayed today. Learn to code. Create apps and have fun ☺</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Zendesk was formulated in Ruby on Rails and provides seamless integration of the back-end helpdesk SaaS to a company&rsquo;s online customer-facing web presence, including hosted support email-ticket integration, online forums, RSS and widgets.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">is the leader for integrated on-demand customer support portal solution based on the latest Web 2.0 technologies and design philosophies.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><img alt=""Zendesk"" src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1403138074/385173v1_pmbxow.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"" title=""Zendesk"" /></p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">13. Hulu</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Hulu is an online video service that offers a selection of hit shows, clips, movies and more at Hulu.com. Monetised through numerous destination sites online, and through the ad-supported subscription service - Hulu Plus.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><img alt=""Hulu"" src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1403138050/hulu1_ci77s7.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"" title=""Hulu"" /></p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">14. Github</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Again similar to Heroku, if your new to the technology world and in any shape or form not used to the word &quot;code&quot;, then you certainly won&#39;t know what Github is. However, you will perk your ear after this. Github is essentially a social network for programmers. With funding in just a few years for a total of $100 million, it has now become one of the leaders for &#39;code sharing&#39; (formerly known as forking, sending and pulling requests), whilst also maintaining your development in your &#39;Git Repository&#39;. You will learn more about Github when you learn to build web apps.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><img alt=""Github"" src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1403138049/291955v1_xtea5f.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"" title=""Github"" /></p>

<h4 style=""text-align:justify"">15. Slideshare</h4>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">This platform is something I particularly like. being a university student, I have found it very useful in receiving valuable information in easy-to-read slides. It&#39;s similar to powerpoint but anyone can find presentations on their topic of interest. Users can tag presentation, and download or embed them into their own websites or blogs. Very cool service. It was acquired by LinkedIn for $119 million.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><img alt=""Slideshare"" src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/coder-factory/image/upload/c_scale,w_800/v1403138056/Slideshare_xrlict.jpg"" class=""img-responsive"" title=""Slideshare"" /></p>

What is Lean Startup?,There have been many different methodologies to unravel the truths of becoming a successful entrepreneur. The Lean Methodology is proving to be the front-runner for entrepreneurs to follow – here’s why.  ,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Using the Lean Startup approach, companies can create order not chaos by providing tools to test a vision continuously.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-ries"" target=""_blank"">Eric Ries</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There has always been debate on what methodologies to follow to become a successful entrepreneur. There are numerous incubators, events, workshops, mentoring&hellip;. whatever you really want to call them, but are they teaching the right methodology? Are they pinpointing the real action to take in reaching business success?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">So what is &ldquo;Lean Startup Methodology&rdquo;?</h3>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://theleanstartup.com/"" target=""_blank"">Lean Startup Methodology</a> is a scientific approach to creating and maintaining start-ups to deliver a desired and demanded product to the market faster and cheaper. Lean methodology is specifically related to start-ups and how to grow the business with maximum acceleration.</p>

Why Teach Kids to Code?,It has become a phenomenon in only recent years that teaching kids to code is a goldmine. But why has it become so apparent now in realising that teaching kids to code is a viable solution for the next generation?,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;The secret of living a life of excellence is merely a matter of thinking thoughts of excellence. Really, it&#39;s a matter of programming our minds with the kind of information that will set us free.&rdquo; - <a href=""http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/charles_r_swindoll.html"" target=""_blank"">Charles R. Swindoll</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&rsquo;s no doubt that we live in a technological world where people understand the use of technologies and what purpose - however, does our upcoming generation even know how these technologies are created?</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The answer to this solution has been the outcry of people pushing the education system to accept coding into schools. The likes of <a href=""http://code.org/"" target=""_blank"">Code.org</a>, <a href=""https://www.codeclub.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"">CodeClub UK</a> (We are partnering up with them in Australia ☺), <a href=""http://coderdojo.com/#zoom=3&amp;lat=48.9225&amp;lon=-35.15625&amp;layers=00B0T"" target=""_blank"">Coderdojo</a> and many others, are pushing the message to teach the up and coming generation of children to learn the concepts of programming as we enter into a more digital diversified age. With the rise of programming jobs recognised by Code.org in the US to increase by 22% in 2020, I personally believe that this movement will become a popular trend in schools all over the world to push for more technologically focused education.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So what does this all mean? Why is it so important for the next generation to learn code? Here is a great info graphic highlighting the why learning programming for kids is not as difficult as one may see. Enjoy ☺</p>

Why online learning will never beat classroom training,Perhaps there will be innovation in online training that brings it closer to having the benefits of classroom training. But I am confident it will never be as good or rewarding for students or teachers. ,"<p dir=""ltr"">I am a coding teacher who loves what he does. Meeting new students, seeing them working towards their goals, witnessing &lsquo;a-ha&rsquo; moments. It is a real joy for me and is why I want to continue doing this for as long as I can.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Sure, the business is not &lsquo;internet scalable&rsquo; like Treehouse and CodeAcademy and the various MOOCs. But I sleep well at night knowing that I am making a real difference in peoples&rsquo; lives and my students are getting true value for their hard earned money.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I get to help my students on their first steps into the tech startup world, I connect them with employers where they will continue their growth and learning and in the process, I make so many new friends - for life.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Now that I have been teaching for a year, I have found so many benefits from classroom training that you just don&rsquo;t get with online courses. Sure there are people who don&rsquo;t need these benefits and are quite successful at teaching themselves online. However, in my experience, these people are few and far between. In fact the vast majority of my students have come to Coder Factory after having tried to teach themselves online and &lsquo;failed&rsquo;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Here I explore the benefits of classroom vs online training from the students&rsquo; perspective - as I see it. Please share your thoughts in the comments.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">First I will discuss the benefits I see with my students in the classroom environment. It is not necessarily implied that the opposite is true for online learning, but these benefits are certainly difficult to achieve in a MOOC. These are also my personal experiences in teaching coding, I have not explored the pros and cons for teaching other disciplines.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">1. The shared experience</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Students get to experience both the challenges and rewards together with other people. First they are confronted with new and difficult concepts, they may start to think of giving up, or thinking &quot;this is too hard for me&quot;. But then they notice other students expressing similar thoughts and emotions. &quot;It&#39;s not just me!&quot;. Then when a student starts to make sense of it, they can rejoice and share they happiness with their classmates.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">2. Motivation from others&#39; success</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Related to the previous point, students are motivated to keep trying and to be patient with themselves when they see other students who moments ago, were just as confused as they are, exclaim their understanding. They think to themselves, &quot;if that person can figure it out, I can too&quot;.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">3. Peer support and assistance</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is not only great to see my students helping each other with the learning challenges they are facing, it is also helping the classmates. The assisting student is learning more as they explain their understanding, and the recipient is usually having something explained in a different way that may make more sense to them. Win, win, win.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">4. Connections - social</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Students who meet in a class find they have many things in common which helps them become good friends and enjoy each others&#39; company both in and outside class. It is cool to see my students warmly welcome each other as the arrive in class and witness the forming of strong bonds.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">5. Connections - business and career</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Already some of my students, who had not met prior to my class, have gone on to work together, starting their own business. Even in the Foundation Programme, which is only 2 days, students make great connections with each other and discover they have complementary talents and ambitions. I see them all eagerly swapping email addresses and phone numbers towards the end of the workshop.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">6. Distraction free environment (or at least minimised distractions)</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Coming to a class, out of the home, away from the distractions of everyday life, is putting yourself in the zone to learn and grow. Sure there are sometimes dramas on our minds that may take us away from the present moment, even in a fun class. But if you are at home, or in a library and trying to concentrate on learning when you have an ongoing issue in your life, there is a very good chance you won&rsquo;t get much work done.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Just being in a place of learning, can help you focus and block out other concerns.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">7. Purpose built environment</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">A classroom is designed for learning. Sure some classrooms are just a room with a bunch of chairs and tables in them but most have the necessary technology and tools needed to assist the learning process.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Having access to whiteboards, big screens and break out areas can really make a big difference.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">8. Tailoring the class delivery</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">A good teacher can adapt their pace and content delivery on the fly, to suit the students in the room. There will always be faster learners than others and being able to manage this with agility and strength is a powerful skill for an educator.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I&rsquo;m still working on being better at that but I do make a promise to my students that no one will get left behind. Thankfully, the fast students usually have the initiative to continue on by themselves or the patience and understanding to wait for me to help a struggling student.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">9. Instantaneous teacher assistance</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Being able to help a student, right then and there, when they are confused, or hit a coding error, is priceless. So many people would give up if teaching themselves, but having a supportive teacher who points them in the right direction and leads them to find the solution on their own, is a powerful benefit of classroom learning.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">10. Serendipity</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Quite often a question or comment from a student can help another student in unexpected ways. This can also lead to more explanation or extra information from the teacher that is not covered in course materials. It can also lead to the courses being improved for future students.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">11. Passion breeding passion</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">I find that my passion for what I teach, rubs off on my students. It reminds me of when I was in class at university and high school. If the teacher was passionate about the subject, I became passionate about it too.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">12. Completion rates</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">After teaching over 80 students in the last year, only 2 students have not completed their programme. That&rsquo;s a 97.5% completion rate (I think that&rsquo;s close to <a href=""http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/opinions/ieee-roundup/low-completion-rates-for-moocs"" target=""_blank""><u>the dropout rate for a MOOC</u></a>). Once students experience the learning they were looking for, they keep coming back until the end.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">13. Speed of learning</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Classroom learning is just so much faster than trying to teach yourself online. Especially when it comes to learning coding. Trying to teach yourself online to a level where you can build apps on your own could take from 6 months up to over a year. I see my students becoming confident coders in just 8 weeks of part time classes (6 hours per week).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">If you want to learn in a hurry, come to a class. It will save you time, money, frustration and you&rsquo;ll make a whole bunch of new friends and meet potential business partners.</p>

<hr />
<p dir=""ltr"">The benefits of online learning are more difficult for me to come up with. I must admit that I have never enjoyed or been very successful at learning online so I welcome any more benefits you may know of.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">1. Self paced</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Being able to learn at a pace that suits you is a great benefit for people that learn very quickly, or very slowly. But by definition these are edge cases.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">2. Learn at times that suit you</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Yes, a face-to-face class is usually at a set time of the day, on particular days of the week. If you have a demanding work schedule that fluctuates, committing to a class may be difficult.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It&rsquo;s also great if you have kids, when they go to bed or otherwise occupied, you can set aside the time to study.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">3. Communicate with many people studying the same course.</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Modern online training platforms enable students to communicate through forums or chat which is a great step forward. Being able to ask questions and read other students&rsquo; solutions is cool. Although I can&rsquo;t help but think that meeting people to face to face in class is still superior to this.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">4. Lower price than classroom training</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">Of course the big draw card for many is the lower price of online training. On the face of it, they seem like a great deal but when you weigh up the benefits of classroom training, there is just no comparison.</p>

Blog your way to success: Why Resumes are old and blogging is the New,"Why Fortune 500 companies to boutique shops are using blogging to increase their digital presence and inevitably increase their bottom line, and why you should do the same to land your career.","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hey rad viewers ☺ How has everyone been? Hope you guys have had a great week thus far and are intrigued by the title. Mmmm yes I&rsquo;m sure you guys are saying&hellip; We can agree that resumes are starting to get boring now, right? If you ever wanted to be successful, now is the time to think outside the box. I saw this badass Interactive resume (which is way above the 99% skill set of you guys reading this&hellip; no offence), but people are finding drastic ways of getting employers attention. I will put the link down the bottom for you guys to check it out. So wicked.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The point I am getting into today is that people always have the tendency to think that less is more. That is true. But when it comes to the technological sector or just any sector in general, you are expected to know your stuff. It&rsquo;s easy to list what your achievements are and then simply list some very kind and some forceful recommendations (let&rsquo;s be honest, we&rsquo;ve all forced someone to write a &ldquo;polished up&rdquo; recommendation for us), but where does hit that speak with employers. What makes that employer stand up, scream his lungs out and say, &ldquo;Dan Siepen is the bomb, why haven&rsquo;t we hired this guy already&rdquo;. (Just using myself as an example ☺). The trend is slowly shifting, there is now a paradigm shift to beat the competition. BLOG! Blog the crap out of all the knowledge you know. Create a website for whatever your purpose or working industry your in. Blogging is the new resume, the new CV. Here are the 2 reasons why:</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Blogging is beneficial &ndash; A pursuit to soothing clarity</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&rsquo;s impossible for people to constantly maintain the craft of blogging and generate new ideas daily. But that&rsquo;s not what it&rsquo;s about. Blogging is about finding yourself. For myself personally, I have been blogging for quite a few months now and have learnt more about myself and my knowledge then I ever knew before&hellip; That&rsquo;s how I got this awesome job of being the Co-Founder of The Coder Factory ☺. Enough about me&hellip; Regardless of your exposure of people seeing your blog, the potential to write blogs about things that you care about, the industry you work in, will not only enhance you, but it will make you legitimate. It shows that there is a caring factor in what you do&hellip; and trust me, employers thrive over that dedication and passion that you can portray though content writing.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Construct and build a blogging audience</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Blogging results in fantastic content creation which people love. Content creates SEO. Building a blog and seeing it grow is one of the coolest experiences to sight. People are actually reading about what you have to say&hellip; your own opinion can attract people of the masses where people you walk past the street couldn&rsquo;t care less.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ability to build a blogging audience, regardless of its viewing audience and analytics, is one fantastic skill to endure with such a greater blogging importance for all individuals involved with technology through to marketing, in order to gain those customers to pay attention to what you have to offer (Like I&rsquo;m doing to you right now ;)).</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are so many great blogging platforms out there for you guys to check out. Here are our top 5 team choices;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&bull; <a href=""http://wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">WordPress.com</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&bull; <a href=""https://www.blogger.com/home"" target=""_blank"">Blogger</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&bull; <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/login"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&bull; <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Australia"" target=""_blank"">Quora</a></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&bull; <a href=""https://svbtle.com/"" target=""_blank"">Svbtle</a></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Farewell Resume, Hello Content</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Goodbye the days of where &lsquo;Less is More&rsquo; and listing of achievements and success. In my experience thus far with helping graduates of The Coder Factory to find new jobs from their coding experience, every startup doesn&rsquo;t always care about what is on a white piece of paper, they care about your portfolio and ask to have links articles to what you have written&hellip; Links? Articles? I haven&rsquo;t any articles at all&hellip; Oh, maybe that one time I did&hellip;? I can&rsquo;t remember&hellip; Don&rsquo;t be that guy and try out Blogging. It&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While blogging is the new resume, blogging isn&rsquo;t for everyone. And that&rsquo;s cool ☺. But I encourage you guys to give it a try. It really could be the difference in why you can&rsquo;t land the jobs that you would kill for if you knew that you had to have that X-factor. Become that X-factor and blog ☺</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Next time guys, I will go through some blogging tips and tricks of how to get the growing audience you want.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Until then, Adios ☺</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These issues and topics I&rsquo;m going to go through briefly are a concern for any type of entrepreneur, but I&rsquo;m going to be a bit biased towards tech entrepreneurship as I&rsquo;m trying to become a successful one myself (and one day I will be&hellip;. It&rsquo;s all about belief and confidence ☺). It often comes about how so many people have so many great business or startup ideas that they want to pursue but don&rsquo;t know how or what it takes to get to believing and creating that dream into a reality.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Do any of you guys have a business idea that is making you tumble in bed? Are you possibly putting it off because it&rsquo;s too hard for you to achieve? With so many great resources out there, in such a time where growth in entrepreneurship is imminent, why not give it a try? Now, I&rsquo;m not saying go quit your job tomorrow to pursue your dreams, but try some things out which you might have never though about, a great start is research, and hopefully this blog is part of that process ☺</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Topic 1: Validate your ideas</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&rsquo;s easy to think of an idea and say, &ldquo;Hey, this could make me rich, famous&hellip; all for the better glory&hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to tell you one thing straight, someone has probably thought of and tried your idea (sorry to disappoint you, but it&rsquo;s true!). This is why validating your ideas are so important. Validation =</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">EXECUTION!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What is one of the best resources to see whether or not your idea has been taken or has been tried before? Good old Google. Yes, it&rsquo;s not only great for looking up nude pics when you were a teenager, or secretly looking up Fox Sports or Sportscenter at work when checking your favourite teams. Google is the greatest asset you will have when it comes to research and validating your ideas.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You will find out what you need to have in store and learn in order for your dreams to come true. Do you know why so many businesses fail? Because they don&rsquo;t do the required research before they jump straight into what they believe might change the world some day. It will save you time and money.<strong>Do your research people!</strong> ☺</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Topic 2: Two partners are better than Solo-Preneurs</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Entrepreneurship can be a lonely game if going in by yourself. Sure, eventually you can hire people for which then you will have company when building your business but sooner or later, the natural instincts of man-kind will take over and lack of motivation and the kick-in of a good friend of mine, laziness, will thrive. Trust me, happens to the best of tech entrepreneurs. Tech entrepreneur businesses or startups, should have two co-founders, at least. You are more likely to gain investment and will produce more ideas to bounce off each other, which in turn will turn into rapid and more efficient decisions.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Start<strong>networking</strong> and find a partner who shares your passion and desire to complete the vision. Combining both of your skills in whatever facets of working careers you come across, will correlate perfectly on so many levels. Two great minds think alike guys ☺</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Topic 3: Got to learn code to increase the load</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I instantly know what you guys are now thinking, &ldquo;How convenient that a guy who works at a coding school, is telling people that they should code&hellip; this must be some sort of sales pitch?&rdquo; I can tell you from minimal experience of my own and networking with people who have been in the tech entrepreneurship game for years, either highly successful or still chasing, that knowing some sort of code whether just web design or functionality through some programming language, it&rsquo;s a necessary skill to have for you or one of your partners. Going in blank faced of building a web-based business isn&rsquo;t going to get you too far. It&rsquo;s like wanting to build a house but you don&rsquo;t know how to punch a nail through a plank of wood.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What do I mean by the heading &lsquo;Learn to code to increase the load&rsquo;? Any good entrepreneur in general knows that knowing the basics of the industry that they want to make big plays in, they must know some of the basics. Want to become the next Zuckerberg? Learn some code. Even if you hire some guy to do the work, I guarantee, there will be quite a few changes through your site in order increase higher conversions and customer growth. If you guys don&rsquo;t know where to dabble and start, try <a href=""http://www.codecademy.com/"" target=""_blank"">CodeAcademy</a> as there are free tutorials for HTML, CSS and other web designs and also learn <a href=""http://rubyonrails.org/"" target=""_blank"">Ruby on Rails</a> which is a easy-to-use coding language which will help you understand and rapidly build your web presence.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Topic 4: Marketing and Sales</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is the final topic that I will be covering in this post for which I think is most important for any tech entrepreneur. You don&rsquo;t need to be some sort of marketing MBA in order to achieve a high generation of leads and conversions for your business. There are so many great resources out there to achieve traffic and sales.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Email is a great start with strong ROI. You guys have to check out <a href=""http://mailchimp.com/"" target=""_blank"">MailChimp</a>, which is a great easy-to-use drag and drop tool for nice visualised emails. I use it frequently and found that many people were viewing them.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SEO. What the hell is that your probably asking? SEO stands for <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Search Engine Optimisation</a>. Look it up. It will soon become your best friend. Research and develop an SEO strategy through blogging. A great way to start is by going to a blogging platform like <a href=""http://wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"">WordPress.com</a> to explore, try out a few things to see if you get traffic and increased searches through keywords. Either way, when you master it, it will become a vital part in making you highly successful in tech entrepreneurship.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hope you guys enjoyed this blog and share with friends or people who might benefit from this. Next time I will talk about the best management tools to use and what I have found in my previous endeavours thus far and what has worked best for me. Until then, have a great day my rad viewers ☺</p>

Why I Dumped Heroku for Ninefold,A comparison between two of the most popular Rails app hosting service providers.,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a Ruby on Rails instructor, part of the courses I teach involves showing my students how to deploy their app to the web. I also operate several Rails apps including The Startup Community and Cerebro, my online student platform.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For years now, I&#39;ve used Heroku for its &#39;simplicity&#39; and low cost - free in most cases. But recently I came across Ninefold&#39;s service and wanted to share my process for deciding which service was best for me.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Features I look for when choosing an app hosting provider.</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""text-align: justify;"">cost</li>
	<li style=""text-align: justify;"">ease of deployment</li>
	<li style=""text-align: justify;"">performance</li>
	<li style=""text-align: justify;"">documentation and support</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">COST</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So of course FREE is best when I&#39;m testing my ideas and playing around. I have about 20 apps lying dormant in my Heroku account, from old versions to quick and dirty demonstration apps.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I&#39;m realistic and don&#39;t expect to get a free lunch. I know I need to pay something if I want good performance and page load times for my users. I can&#39;t expect the free lunch in these cases.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With Heroku, I can add more resources (or dynos) when needed and at $34.50 a pop. To have 2 web worker dynos running is not too bad but it adds up quickly when you starting adding more.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ninefold doesn&#39;t offer a free tier so I don&#39;t use it for my test apps but as its lowest tier costs only $44 it&#39;s very reasonable for my live apps where it&#39;s important to have immediate page loading for my users.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As I have yet to have the &#39;problem&#39; of a huge amount of traffic, I can&#39;t comment on the cost/benefits of each service when using more resources.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>For my needs, the winner for COST is: Draw</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">EASE OF DEPLOYMENT</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I always thought Heroku to be very simple to deploy. But that was because I hadn&#39;t anything to compare it to before now. There are a whole bunch of Heroku commands to learn which can be overwhelming for my students and it is rare that an app launches without problems the first time. Of course it is a great experience for my students to debug their production server but a lack of unnecessary problems is even better.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SSH key issues, special gems to allow Rails 4 apps to work, problems with asset pipeline are just some of the issues my students face with Heroku.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For Ninefold, creating the app and linking it to my Github repository was as simple as simple can be. I have not yet faced any issues at all. It was even easy to migrate my postgresql database from Heroku across to Ninefold.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Winner: Ninefold</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My performance judgements are entirley subjective as I have not run bench testing at all. However, I was astounded by the page load times I see from my apps hosted at Ninefold -- even though I am using the lower cost, US based servers and I&#39;m based in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Winner: Ninefold</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">DOCUMENTATION AND SUPPORT</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I find both Heroku and Ninefold have great documentation and easy to follow step by step guides for setting things up and solving issues.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Winner: Draw</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Overall winner: Ninefold!</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the end of the day, when I&#39;m teaching my students how to deploy their apps or I&#39;m deploying my own apps. I have to recommend you check out Ninefold. Their ease of deployment, performance and excellent and they are, in my opinion, very reasonably priced.</p>

Coder Factory student is now a startup founder,"Mark Collins, one of The Coder Factory's first students, has been accepted into not one, but two startup accelerators after completing his Rails coding course.","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Both <a href=""http://incubate.org.au/"" target=""_blank"">Incubate</a> and Telstra&#39;s <a href=""https://muru-d.com/"" target=""_blank"">Muru-D</a> have accepted Mark&#39;s startup, <a href=""http://www.vistr.com.au/"" target=""_blank"">Vistr</a>. I chat to Mark and find out more about his journey and what it was like to learn coding at The Coder Factory.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Congratulations on being accepted into Incubate Summer 2014 programme. What has the experience been like so far?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: It has been great. We have spent a lot of time fine tuning our business model and understanding exactly what the customer wants.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: What can you tell us about your new startup?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: Vistr is an online financial tool that lets small businesses improve their cashflow to form better forecasting. It is early days, but we are making good progress and learning quickly.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Tell us about your team/co-founders.</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: There are three of us in total, myself, Jeremy and Alex. We kind of met by chance and all thought that the problem we were solving was important. I have a background in management consulting, Jeremy is an ex investment banker and Alex is a developer.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: What is your involvement in producing your product?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: I joined the team in early November and have been handling most of the development to date. Essentially, I build a basic solution that let us test the produce and features with clients. Alex is a professional developer and will be the tech lead from now on and I will start to focus more on some business development, but also help out with the coding a fair bit.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Is being in a startup all you&rsquo;d hoped it would be?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: I tried not to have any expectations about what it would be like. Overall, the main expectation I had was that I would enjoy myself, which has definitely come true.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: What was your experience with coding before you started at The Coder Factory?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: Not much really. I had done a few of the CodeAcademy courses on HTML, CSS and Ruby, but didn&rsquo;t really have any idea how to put it all together.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Why did you want to learn coding?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: I&rsquo;ve always been quite a technical person and enjoyed maths and logic. When I decided I wanted to get involved in the start-up scene and found a company, it seems natural that if you want to be involved in a tech start up, you need to be able to code and build MVPs.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Why did you choose The Coder Factory?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: I heard about the Coder Factory through the Rails Community. It seemed to cover off all the topics I wanted and was reasonably priced.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: What did you enjoy most about studying at The Coder Factory?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: Great team of students who helped each other</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: Are you glad you decided to learn coding?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: Most definitely. I had always wanted to do it and thoroughly enjoy the &lsquo;building&rsquo; things and seeing them come to life.</p>

<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">TCF: What would you say to other people thinking of learning coding?</h4>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MC: If you want to be involved in the tech start-up world, I think you need to understand coding. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you will be a full time developer, but you need to be able understand what is going on and speak the tech language. It is also fun!!! If you enjoy building things and seeing ideas come to life, then I would strongly recommend you get in contact with the guys at The Coder Factory.</p>

Will at some point everyone have to become an Entrepreneur?,"Not too long ago, entrepreneurship used to be an ugly word. Nowadays, some of the world’s most famous people are entrepreneurs. While people have dreams of becoming a successful entrepreneur, here is an info graphic suggesting it might become a norm. ","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&ldquo;Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.&rdquo; - Albert Einstein</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It&rsquo;s no mistake to find that everywhere you look from the people you may know, to browsing online of all the different small businesses, to seeing your colleague leave the corporate world for a better lifestyle business - entrepreneurship is on the rise. With massive job cuts by some of the world&rsquo;s biggest organisations, where does this leave these unemployed individuals? I can guarantee you that this will become a more popular occurrence where big companies realise that there business systems can become more efficient without certain employee sectors.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With a high spike in the number of freelancers and consultants, which are much cheaper than full-time employees, it&rsquo;s not surprising that businesses are seeking to these individuals to get these tasks done rather than hiring employees. We&rsquo;ve even seen some of the world&rsquo;s largest motor companies cut massive employee numbers due to more robotics. Will Robots take over the world?</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is an increasing paradigm shift in which this world is heading to in terms of employment and entrepreneurship. Here is a great info graphic highlighting some forecast estimates and reasons why &lsquo;entrepreneurship&rsquo; could be prominent word for individuals around the world.</p>

Taking Coding Mainstream in 2014,"My main goal for 2014 at The Coder Factory, is to bring coding into the mainstream. I want people to see that coding is not just for geeks and nerds, everyone can learn to code and build apps that make their lives better.","<p>My vision is for kids, grannies, hipsters, lawyers, accountants, doctors, tradies and chefs to be coding. There are so many possibilities out there where having the power to code, can improve your work and your life forever.</p>

<h2>The year that was</h2>

<p>The last year has been speeding us towards this time in history. Hardly a day goes by that I don&#39;t hear coding being talked about it the press or on tv.</p>

<p>2013 saw a <a href=""https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/fee8f3ee97a0"" target=""_blank"">homeless man learning to code</a> and releasing apps. We marvelled at <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_suarez_a_12_year_old_app_developer.html"" target=""_blank"">a 12 year old kid</a> presenting a TED talk about his apps on the app store.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago, <a href=""http://code.org/"" target=""_blank"">Code.org</a>, the American organisation doing a great job of pushing the &#39;coding in schools&#39; agenda, ran the successful <a href=""http://code.org/educate/hoc"" target=""_blank"">Hour of Code</a>. Over 20 million kids had a go at coding, more than the total number of kids to ever learn computer science before that week.</p>

<p>In November, I spoke at <a href=""http://www.ignitesydney.com/"" target=""_blank"">Ignite Sydney</a>, a short format talk event. My chosen topic, &quot;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EYx5eEqVBE"" target=""_blank"">Teach the world to code</a>&quot; must have inspired President Obama because 3 days after the video of my talk was released on Youtube, Obama <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XvmhE1J9PY"" target=""_blank"">uploaded a speech</a> encouraging all Americans to learn to code. :)</p>

<h2>Strategy for 2014</h2>

<p>To achieve my goal and make coding mainstream, I am making some plans and devising a strategy.</p>

<h3>Javascript courses</h3>

<p>To kick off, The Coder Factory is offering <a href=""http://thecoderfactory.com/courses/angular-coder"" target=""_blank"">Australia&#39;s first Angular.js course</a>. If you are a Rails developer (or other MVC framework developer) looking to take your web applications to the next level, come and learn Angular.</p>

<p>Javascript MVC frameworks are the future of front end web development. You have to be living with your head in a bag if you haven&#39;t noticed the increasing buzz and demand for Javascript skills.</p>

<h3>Summer of Code</h3>

<p>I will be announcing more Coder Factory initiatives every week during this #summerofcode. Look out, it&#39;s going to be a huge year for coding!</p>

<p>Enjoy the rest of your holidays and #learntocode!</p>

Why Learning in Classrooms is better than online resources. Part 2.,"In Part 2 of this series, this will hopefully improve the correlation between Classroom learning and Online learning and will hopefully give you a better perspective on what is the right choice for your success.","<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hey rad viewers ☺ and welcome to others that may have never seen this blog before, I will be continuing the 2-part series on why learning in classrooms is better than online resources when building your own apps and businesses. You are now also part of the rad community ☺</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As previously mentioned in <a href=""https://thecoderfactory.com/posts/Why-Learning-in-Classrooms-is-better-than-online-resources-%E2%80%93-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">part 1 of this blog post</a>, being a cofounder of <strong>The Coder Factory gives me the opportunity to meet</strong> aspiring entrepreneurs who have tried to learn code online and build their own startups and businesses without really knowing what the best program is to learn, what direction and focus they should take in terms of web design, what is the best marketing tactics in terms of functionality and design to gain the most traction, etc.&hellip; etc.&hellip; The list is endless. There are numerous factors to consider that most entrepreneurs just simply don&rsquo;t know about.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As I explained in part 1, &ldquo;Whatever your purposes, for a career opportunity or running your business, learning in the classroom, such as a coding school, is much more effective in gaining employment and increasing your chances of a successful business venture or tech startup.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Coding sounds like a daunting task (and trust me, at first I had exactly the same feeling), but learning a little code will not only help you in discovery and creativity, but help you have more power and control over your business to <strong>gain higher customer acquisition</strong>.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You guys should read this article (a little old I know, but serves the same core meaning) by Venture Beat interviewing the Co-Founder and CEO of <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2012/09/17/why-everyone-should-code/"" target=""_blank"">CodeAcademy, Zach Sims</a>. It&rsquo;s a skill and investment that would never be regretted, hence why I&rsquo;m so passionate in letting people know and that learning in a classroom environment is a fun experience.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here are the other 2 reasons why Learning in classrooms is better than online resources;</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Networking</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From my experience thus far, learning in a classroom has already helped me gain quite a few useful contacts for my start-up. Networking is critical and is the catalyst for success.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When enrolling for any start-up bootcamps or coding classes, you will instantly have your networking skills put to the test. You will mix with people who have similar ambitions and goals that they want to achieve emotionally, financially and most importantly, passionately. The ability to network is an art and will make you become more proficient with your business and programmers also increasing their skills. Two perfect examples are Mark Collins, a former student of The Coder Factory, has been accepted in the <a href=""http://incubate.org.au/incubator/"" target=""_blank"">Incubator program at the University of Sydney</a> for his start-up, Viber (Exciting blog post coming very soon on Mark as well ☺).</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another recent example is Phil Simmonds being hired by <a href=""http://blackcitrus.com.au/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Black Citrus</a>. The perfect way to start networking is by going to workshops and learning in classrooms where it&rsquo;s not just going there to work, but you make great friends too. This is not possible when learning online. Yes, it costs money, sure thing, but I guarantee it is the best investment you will ever make, if you want to be highly successful that is (I&rsquo;m sure you do ☺).</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">4. Fast-paced learning and working on project while learning at the same time.</h2>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Here is the final reason why I chose to be a coding student and do it in a classroom instead of learning online. It&rsquo;s so much DAMN FASTER. I&rsquo;ve picked up things where I learned it on CodeAcademy, like CSS and HTML, and did it within 2 lessons, where learning it online took me a couple of weeks.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most of you guys are probably now thinking, &ldquo;Ha! Well maybe your just not to switched on aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not suggesting that I&rsquo;m witty either, but trust me, I&rsquo;m quite switched on. But it goes back to my first reason back in Part 1&hellip; motivation. Lack of motivation and socialising is the huge reason it took me a couple of weeks to learn.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It was cool building a site and learning basic web design, and I encourage people to take that initial step to see how coding works, but just imagine the possibilities of building a whole project in only a handful of weeks, in a fun learning environment whilst networking at the same time (that it will eventually become subliminal to you). If I were you, learning in the classroom is the best option.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Let me know what you rad viewers think of these reasons. I would love to hear maybe why you might disagree or maybe agree on some points and not others. Also, please if anyone can think of other reasons I would like to hear them as well.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Until next time, Peace ☺</p>

Student interview - Sylvain Aimoz,Sylvain is one of our most advanced students. He is a genuine geek who is totally into game development. Sylvain took our advanced course as well as our Angular.JS course and was kind enough to tell us a little bit about his experience.,"<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Hi Sylvain, thank you for taking the time to tell the community about your experience!&nbsp;</strong><strong>Could you tell us a bit about yourself?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I&rsquo;m just a geek that had the &ldquo;chance&rdquo; to get a computer quite late compared to my friends when&nbsp;I was a kid (yeah 16yo, not such a kid anymore right?)... I used to change the components,&nbsp;install, re-install, re-re-install windows because something went wrong while patching games&nbsp;and updating dodgy drivers back in the old era of the late 90&rsquo;s.. and then I studied electronics&nbsp;and after that, network management because I thought I would enjoy it.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>You took our Advanced Web App Developer Deluxe program, how did you find it and&nbsp;have you enjoyed the experience?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It was a pretty cool experience, lots to learn, sometimes obvious, sometimes it left me clueless,&nbsp;but that&rsquo;s what happen when you&rsquo;re learning!&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>At the Coder Factory, we believe Coding is a necessary skill in the 21st Century. What&nbsp;are your thoughts on this statement?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Well, definitely! Computers are not only on the boss&rsquo;s desk anymore&hellip; They&rsquo;re in your pockets&nbsp;24/7! Obviously there&rsquo;s a difference between using them and developing software for them,&nbsp;but it would be like having car and not knowing what&rsquo;s that red light on the dashboard means..&nbsp;And yes, this red light means the handbrake is still on.. It&rsquo;s a silly comparison, but the more you&nbsp;know about your tools, the more you can achieve.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>It&rsquo;s safe to say you&rsquo;re now quite familiar with coding, do you think you will transverse&nbsp;these skills in creating your own tech startup and enhance your innovative possibilities&nbsp;in the digital landscape?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I have been coding for quite a while, but at an amateur level, using tools and tweaking a few&nbsp;things in hexadecimal and stuff like that but it has always been quite obscure, and to be honest&nbsp;it will still be for a while.. coding can be compared to talking, you create sounds and say words,&nbsp;but remember how much time it took to learn your native language? Yep, let&rsquo;s say 10 years to&nbsp;be &ldquo;OK&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s just the beginning!Same for coding, you use a, or should I say, many languages at the same time and to be fluent&nbsp;in coding, you need to spend time practicing and learning more. You need to learn the logic, the&nbsp;syntax and the vocabulary, which are different in assembler, C, javascript, HTML and that&rsquo;s just&nbsp;the tip of the iceberg&hellip;I&rsquo;ve done a few websites back in the days, when it was only just few static webpages, and I&nbsp;was using the few concept that I knew to help me doing IT and &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with videogames, and&nbsp;by playing I mean doing maps, and what we would call mods nowadays.. And after few years&nbsp;discovering software like Blender and lately Unity3D, I tried to develop one by myself, and&nbsp;that&rsquo;s mainly why I decided to do that small course, just to give me more insights of what was&nbsp;happening, and let me tell you, the more you know, the less you know!</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>You have also taken our inaugural AngularJs class. How did you find it and will you use&nbsp;AngularJs in future projects?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">I tend to say, never say never, and AngularJS is pretty awesome, with many cutting-edge&nbsp;concepts that will definitely push web-programming to something always more dynamic,&nbsp;evolving and secure, but what I&rsquo;m working on at the moment would not work with angularJS as&nbsp;it&rsquo;s mainly &ldquo;native&rdquo;, but as I make it available online.. you never know, at some point maybe the&nbsp;technologies will get close enough to use them together.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>If you have to give any advice on people interested in learning coding and web app&nbsp;development, what would you say?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">You can do it online, read books etc.. but if you can do the class at the coder factory, you will&nbsp;have a better and quicker understanding of what&rsquo;s going on. It&rsquo;s pretty cheap when you think&nbsp;to the time you will save at the start and straight to the point, get the basics and then pick tips&nbsp;online, like when you&rsquo;re passing your driver&rsquo;s licence, learn to drive and then go on a road trip!</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>Thank you for your time Sylvain!</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Despite being an amazing resource, it isn&rsquo;t free. For a $9 a month fee, you can get everything from every old episode to an extra advanced episode each week. If you want to supercharge your Ruby on Rails learning and experience, then it might be worth paying the small fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><a href=""http://s1373.photobucket.com/user/dan16/media/ScreenShot2014-06-07at125340PM_zpsb0176438.png.html"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""RailsCasts"" src=""http://i1373.photobucket.com/albums/ag381/dan16/ScreenShot2014-06-07at125340PM_zpsb0176438.png"" style=""border-style:solid; border-width:1px; height:341px; width:650px"" /></a></p>

Student interview - Jessa Boanas-Dewes,Jessa is the founder and director of Toot Sweet. She has taken our Foundation Programme and we are very happy that she agreed to tell us about her experience.,"<p><strong>Thanks for agreeing to do this Interview with us Jessa. Before we ask&nbsp;you further questions, do you mind telling us about your career background and&nbsp;your business Toot Sweet?</strong></p>

<p>Sure! I founded Toot Sweet over six years ago and now we have teams in Australia&nbsp;and New Zealand. Toot Sweet specialises in technical and business writing for bids&nbsp;and tenders &ndash; particularly for multi-million and multi-billion dollar civil construction&nbsp;projects in Australia. We mainly work with engineers to &lsquo;translate&rsquo; their technical&nbsp;knowledge and expertise, into clear, concise and easy-to-read text, so that their&nbsp;clients can easily understand the solutions and benefits they propose. My career&nbsp;background is in publishing (my favourite was working at Lonely Planet!), sustainable&nbsp;development, marketing and analysis.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Great to hear about your business Toot Sweet, where do you plan on taking</strong>&nbsp;<strong>the company in terms of growth?</strong></p>

<p>Toot Sweet has grown organically in a really great way &ndash; we have a great culture and&nbsp;really amazing writers, so I&rsquo;m very conscious of keeping that and enhancing it as we&nbsp;grow. The plan is to continue to grow team sizes and add teams in more cities. The&nbsp;challenge is now to make sure our systems are ready for the next stage of growth!&nbsp;Which is why I became interested in learning about the potential of coding.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations on completing your first course with coderfactory.&nbsp;What was the experience like?</strong></p>

<p>I loved coming to class and seeing how quickly you can create apps, websites and&nbsp;systems that are exactly what your business or client needs. The environment was incredibly friendly and the teachers were fun and super helpful.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What can you tell us about what you built?</strong></p>

<p>Ahhh, not much yet &ndash; but it gave me a great grounding in what is possible, which is what I wanted!</p>

<p><strong>Tell us why you wanted to learn to build an app and what you hope to get&nbsp;out of it.</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to get an idea of what sort of back end systems I could build (or have&nbsp;someone build for me) so that I can strengthen and build my business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What do you think about learning Technology and coding and has it has&nbsp;any impact on the way you look at business? Has it generated more thoughts on&nbsp;how to implement better Technological decisions?</strong></p>

<p>I think coding is a great thing to learn &ndash; it&rsquo;s definitley impacted the way I look at business. I feel that&nbsp;my creativity and ideas have increased now that I have a better idea of what is possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What did you enjoy most about studying at coderfactory?</strong></p>

<p>Peter&rsquo;s sense of humour!</p>

<p><strong>Are you satisfied that you learned code? Did you find it difficult?</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find it difficult at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do you believe coding is just for &ldquo;geeks&rdquo; or &ldquo;nerds&rdquo;?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think I am a nerd! But no of course not, I think it&rsquo;s for everyone. It&rsquo;s an incredibly powerful&nbsp;tool.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What would you say to other people interested in learning to code?</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say get in to it!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In one sentence, how would you describe coderfactory?</strong></p>

<p>A great, open and forward-thinking factory of fabulous coders!</p>
